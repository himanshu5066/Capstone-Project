Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict property prices based on various features such as property type, size, location attributes, and amenities. The goal is to assist stakeholders—buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts—in making informed decisions.

Libraries:- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc

The dataset contains multiple features that influence the price of residential properties. Below is a summary of some of the key columns:

Column Name	Description
PropertyID	Unique identifier for the property
SalePrice	Target variable: price of the property (in lakhs)
PropertyClass	Category/type of the property (e.g., residential, commercial)
PropertySize	Size of the property (in square feet)
OverallQual	Overall quality score of the property (1–10)
YearBuilt	Year the property was built
BsmtSqFootage	Basement square footage
GrLivArea	Above-ground living area (in square feet)
GarageCars	Number of car spaces in the garage
FullBath	Number of full bathrooms
HalfBath	Number of half bathrooms
Neighborhood	Area or neighborhood of the property

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and distributions in the data.
Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical features, scaling, and dimensionality reduction (if needed).
Model Training: Using regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating performance using R² Score, MAE, RMSE.
Deployment (Optional): Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit.

Model Evaluation Metrics
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures average error magnitude.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
